Data science project: Oceans Institute membership expertise inventory with integration to UWA PURE Repository and Sitecore Website

Project Title:

Oceans Institute Member Expertise Inventory – Data Integration and Display

Project Overview:

The UWA Oceans Institute (OI) seeks to build a dynamic, integrated expertise inventory that showcases the capabilities of its 400+ research members. The aim is to centralise and visualise member expertise using existing internal spreadsheets, enhanced with live data from UWA’s Research Repository (built on the PURE platform). The final inventory will integrate with the Oceans Institute’s public-facing website (Sitecore SXA) to support collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and strategic reporting.

Core Objective:

Develop a prototype system that:

· Consolidates internal member data (skills, themes, institutions, collaborations) into a structured format

· Pulls relevant publication and grant data from the UWA Research Repository via API or dynamic SQL query

· Outputs a cleaned, filterable dataset that can be integrated or displayed on the OI website (Sitecore).

Key Deliverables:

· Cleaned and structured membership expertise database

· Integration script or logic to query and extract researcher outputs from PURE

· A filtered export (CSV or JSON) suitable for display on the Sitecore SXA website

· A prototype display page or mock-up demonstrating how the filtered data could appear on the Sitecore site

· Clear documentation for future maintenance and updates.

Technology Requirements:

· Ability to query the PURE Research Repository (SQL or API)

· Output format compatible with Sitecore SXA (e.g., CSV, JSON, or data feed)

· Tools: SQL, Python, or other data integration tools.

Learning Objectives:

· Work with institutional data platforms (PURE, Sitecore).
